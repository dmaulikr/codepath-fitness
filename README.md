####Our Target User...
* Is technically inclined
* Has a medium-high fitness IQ
* Wants to work towards a specific goal 
* Works out regularly (1-4 times/week)
* Wants help with their routine but doesn't want to pay for a trainer
* Doesn't have a lot of free time to work out, wants to maximize efficiency 
* Often works out alone
* Is bored or discouraged about their workout regimen

####Guiding Principles / Differentiators 
* Allows for flexibility (there isn't one right way to use it)
* Offers variation and learning opportunities workout to workout
* Doesn't require you to look at it often, if you don't want to
* Provides an overview, with more detail always a tap away
* Is non-rigid (let's you swap out exercises, doesn't hold you to strict timelines by exercise)

####Basic Functionality
1. Welcome experience
2. Pick a duration
3. Pick a location (with equipment)
4. Pick a workout type (full body, upper body, lower body, pre-cardio, stretch, rehab, express)
5. View a list of recommended exercises 
6. Edit the list of exercises 
7. "Play" the workout

9. Lock the screen

####Backend Considerations
